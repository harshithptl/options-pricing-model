# Option Pricing Models

This repository implements three classic option pricing models in Python:

- ‚úÖ **Black-Scholes Model**
- ‚úÖ **Binomial Model (Cox-Ross-Rubinstein)**
- ‚úÖ **Monte Carlo Simulation**

Each model is implemented as an object-oriented class inheriting from a shared abstract base class to ensure consistent interfaces. This design makes it easy to extend, test, and integrate these models for use in trading research and strategy development.

## üîé Models and Descriptions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Black-Scholes Model

**Description**:
A closed-form analytical formula for European options assuming constant volatility, log-normal asset prices, and continuous trading.

**Features**:
- European call and put pricing
- Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho)

**Pros**:
‚úÖ Fast, closed-form solution  
‚úÖ Widely used and well-understood  
‚úÖ Greeks easily computed analytically  

**Cons**:
‚ö†Ô∏è Only valid for European options  
‚ö†Ô∏è Assumes constant volatility  
‚ö†Ô∏è Doesn't model early exercise or dividends directly

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Binomial Model (Cox-Ross-Rubinstein)

**Description**:
A discrete-time tree model that approximates option prices by modeling the underlying asset's possible paths over multiple periods.

**Features**:
- European and American option pricing
- Early exercise feature for American options

**Pros**:
‚úÖ Handles American-style early exercise  
‚úÖ Intuitive tree structure  
‚úÖ Converges to Black-Scholes as steps increase  

**Cons**:
‚ö†Ô∏è Slower than closed-form solutions  
‚ö†Ô∏è Requires choosing number of steps (trade-off between accuracy and speed)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Monte Carlo Simulation

**Description**:
Uses random sampling of asset price paths under risk-neutral measure to estimate the expected discounted payoff.

**Features**:
- European call and put pricing
- Simulates many random paths

**Pros**:
‚úÖ Flexible and intuitive  
‚úÖ Easily extended to exotic options  
‚úÖ Handles complex payoffs  

**Cons**:
‚ö†Ô∏è Computationally intensive  
‚ö†Ô∏è Requires many simulations for accuracy  
‚ö†Ô∏è Not well-suited for American options without complex modifications
